# Quiplash Clone (Part 1)
This Project was created as a part of the Cloud Application Development module at the University of Southampton.

For this coursework we were tasked with creating a Quiplash Clone using Python and Azure for the backend API, and NodeJS, Javascript and Google Cloud for the frontend.

This part of the coursework involved creating an API to hold the stateless and persistent components of the game - the users and the prompts. Azure functions was used to allow people to register, login, submit prompts and to allow for the retrieval of prompts and player data.

Unfortunately, due to us only having temporary free access to Azure and Google Cloud, the project has been taken offline.
